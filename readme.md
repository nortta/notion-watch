# Notion Watch
Add a watcher to Notion to ping your endpoint as you make changes.

![demo](https://github.com/nortta/notion-watch/assets/10030505/2959176a-e2a2-42c8-9a60-a1749f7bf3bf)

[Install on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notion-watch/makcpchjjdmjapoeojoeakkapjkbinja?hl=en&authuser=0)

## Why?
One of the limitations of Notion is its lack of support for webhooks, which makes it almost impossible to track when a page is changed.

Notion Watch adds a watcher to Notion in your web browser and pings your configured endpoint each time it detects a change.

The extension also adds a Sync button to Notion's UI. You may optionally disable the watcher and rely on the button to trigger pings manually.
